              <p>
                 My name is Parth Mali and i am your future software developer in baking! I am currently pursuing a software developer boot camp course from University Of Toronto. To seek a responsible and challenging career as a Developer which provisdes an opportunity to unveil my skills and continuously develop them while at work. I have completed Chemical Lab Technician with Pharmaceuticals-Advanced diploma course from Seneca college. I started working at age of 18. From being Team member to General Manager in Tim Hortons and currently working as QA tech in Ace bakery acquired by FGF Foods. FGF is a bakery company which manufactures all bakery items such as naan, bagel, muffins, baguette, pizza, croissants etc. at a large scale.

                 In the year end of 2022, I decided to pursue something which was very new to me but I had confidence in myself that i can pull it off. After joining the software developer course I found my inspiration, passion, desire and determination which I felt was lacking while working in my current job. I personally prefer playing any sport game for instance cricket, volleyball, basketball, tennis, badminton etc. during my free time. Other than this activities I like spending time with my pet Oliver and playing cards with family and friends.
